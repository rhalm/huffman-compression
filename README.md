# Data compression with Huffman coding

## Usage
First navigate to the executable file with the command line and then write one of the following commands:

`huffman compress sample.txt`: compresses the sample.txt file <br>
`huffman decompress sample.hm`: decompresses the sample.hm file and creates a sample-out.txt output file

This algorithm is most efficient at compression with larger data.
